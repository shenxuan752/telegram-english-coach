   ```bash
   cd /Users/a90362/Documents/D/AI_Project/gemini/telegram-english-coach
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   
   # Create repo on GitHub, then:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/telegram-english-coach.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Go to Railway**
   - Visit: https://railway.app
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repo

## Check if Bot is Running

```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# Check status
railway status
```

---

## Cost
- **Free tier**: $5 credit/month
- **Your bot usage**: ~$2-3/month
- **No overages**: Stops when credit runs out (safe!)

---

## Troubleshooting

**Bot not responding?**
```bash
railway logs --follow
```

**Redeploy:**
```bash
railway up
```

**Remove deployment:**
```bash
railway down
```
